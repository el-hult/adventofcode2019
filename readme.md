# Solution for Advent of Code 2019

## Installation
I've developed in a `conda` environment. Use `freeze.txt` to recreate that environment.

I've also used the test runners in PyCharm, so `nose` and `unittest` is nice to use. I've added the `.idea`-folder so 
that test setups has come along. 

## Running solutions
The files `day{x}_runner.py` gives the right answers. Run them.
